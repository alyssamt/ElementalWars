Summary:
Elemental Wars is a 1v1 top-down battle arena with two ways to win: kill the other player, or destroy both of their towers. Each player has a primary and secondary attack, which depend on the element the player chooses. There are four elements - fire, water, earth, and air - each with their own unique abilities and playstyle.


Player Experience:
While playing Elemental Wars, we hope that the player will feel an ‘element’ of suspense and determination to win against their real-life opponent. The player should be able to embody their element of choice by understanding their capabilities and 'feeling' the consequences of what is happening in-game. The experience should be fast-paced, competitive, and demanding of focus, so that players are not thinking about anything else while battling in-game.
